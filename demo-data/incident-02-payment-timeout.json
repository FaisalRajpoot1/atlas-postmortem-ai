  "description": "All payment transactions started failing with timeout errors at 09:30 UTC. Users were unable to complete any purchases. Our payment provider's API was returning 504 Gateway Timeout errors for all requests.\n\nRevenue impact was immediate and significant. Customer support received over 500 tickets within the first 30 minutes. The issue was ultimately traced to an expired SSL certificate on our payment provider's side.",
